## :wrench: **Install instructions**

### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) `git clone https://github.com/funnyjerry/react-native-expo-promota-mvp.git`
- 1.2) `cd react-native-expo-promota-mvp` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with `yarn install`
        **Note:** NPM has issues with React Native so `yarn` is recommended over `npm`.
#### 2) Start your app

- 2.1) **[Expo Code]** Build and run the iOS app, run `expo start` (to run on simulator) or `expo start --device` (to run on real device) from the root of your project. The first build will take some time.
